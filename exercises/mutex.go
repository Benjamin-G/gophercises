// So, a mutex, or a mutual exclusion is a mechanism that allows us to prevent concurrent processes from entering a critical section of data whilst itâ€™s already being executed by a given process.

// need to use a mutex to guard any updates to any variables.
// Everything you can achieve with a Mutex can be done with a channel in Go if the size of the channel is set to 1.

// the use case for what is known as a binary semaphore - a semaphore/channel of size 1 - is so common in the real world that it made sense to implement this exclusively in the form of a mutex
